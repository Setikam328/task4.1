            Astronomy is the study of everything in the universe beyond Earth's atmosphere. That includes objects we can see with our naked eyes, like the Sun , the Moon , the planets, and the stars .

            Stellar Astronomy studies how stars are formed, their evolution, and the processes that occur during the different stages of their life cycles. Solar Astronomy focuses its studies on the Sun, the center of our solar system, and the closest star to our planet.<br>
            <u>The largest known star in the universe is UY Scuti</u>. It has an estimated radius of 1.188 billion kilometers. If UY Scuti were the center of our solar system, its photosphere, or outer shell, would reach just past the orbit of Jupiter. It is a red hypergiant, meaning it has an enormous mass and luminosity.
            Stars are the most widely recognized astronomical objects, and represent the most fundamental building blocks of galaxies. The age, distribution, and composition of the stars in a galaxy trace the history, dynamics, and evolution of that galaxy.
            The stars seem to twinkle in the night sky due to the effects of the Earth's atmosphere. When starlight enters the atmosphere, it is affected by winds in the atmosphere and areas with different temperatures and densities. This causes the light from the star to twinkle when seen from the ground.
